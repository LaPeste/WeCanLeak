Authentic Early Medieval Ages Audio Pack FREE: SETUP GUIDE

Dear Unity Developer,
Thank you for downloading this package!
This is the free version of the Authentic Early Medieval Ages Audio Pack.
You will find a few music, ambient and sound FX resources to give you an idea of what you will find in the full pack.

Here are some indications as to how to use this pack.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
GENERAL REMARKS:

- DO NOT, under any circumstance, change the folder structure of the "Resources" folder.  The resources folder HAS to be located in your asset folder and the folder structure HAS to remain untouched.
  The reason is that many scrips rely on this folder structure to load the samples into arrays. Many scripts could stop working if you change the folder structure.

- Some samples can be looped using the "loop" function of Unity but others rely on scripts to ensure there is no "break" in the sound.
  In order to avoid abrupt cuts in the natural release of instruments (the time it takes for the reverb and sound to completely disappear) you have to alternate between two samples instead of looping them.
  The samples that work with the Unity "loop" function are located only in the "Ambient" and the "FX loopable" folders.  All other samples require a script to loop seamlessly.

- You can open the demo scenes and run them to hear how the two provided scripts work (in the "Scripts" folder) or you can drag and drop the scripts onto the "Main Camera" object to launch the music.

*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************


1) random music or mood scripts

The script entitled "random_guitar" will play random "lute like" riffs that are designed for calm moments in the game.
All you need to do is drag and drop the script on the "main Camera" Unity object.  In this pack, there are only 4 "riffs" to choose from at random.
There are 16 in the full pack to ensure a much wider variety in the randomness of the samples being played.

2) Seven full pieces of music (one loopable)

The 7 pieces of music can be found in the "Music" folder". One can be looped seamlessly: the "title" music.
If you want to play it in a loop, simply go to the "Scripts" folder and attach either the "title" script to any object.
The 3 pieces entitled "folk dance" were rendered from the random soundtrack generation script of the full version of this pack.

The "church organs" piece was rendered from the random church organ generation script of the full version of this pack.

3) 3 chimes to underline events

There are 3 chimes available for your game in the "Chimes" folder.  These are very short jingles that you can use when an event occurs like a victory, the acquisition of a new item etc.

4) Ambiance sounds, all loopable

In the "Ambient" folder, you will find a few ambiance sounds that you can attach to any object, using the "loop" function in Unity.

5) As a bonus, a couple of medieval sound FX

I am mostly a music composer and by no means a specialist in special effects.  This is why I am offering these samples as a "bonus" and not as an "official" part of this package. 
They are a combination of my own recordings and various samplings from royalty free sources.  Therefore, there can be a big difference in the sound quality and "footprint".
What I mean by this is, it is very important to use the same microphone as often as possible when creating sound effects otherwise they will "sound" very different between samples, which does not always
sound very good. 

Please refer yourself to the videos I have put online to demo this pack as you can see how everything works!

I hope you'll be able to make use of this!
Don't forget to leave a review and suggestions/ideas for how to make this work even better!
I have purposefully created a variety of music/soundtrack solutions so that you can test them and provide me with feedback on the ones you prefer and would like me to enhance in future updates!

Thanks again for listening! 

sincerely,

Marma
